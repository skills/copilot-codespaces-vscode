_Welcome to "	Develop With AI Powered Code Suggestions Using GitHub Copilot and VS Code"! :wave:_

GitHub Copilot is an AI pair programmer that helps you write code faster and with less work. It draws context from comments and code to suggest individual lines and whole functions instantly. GitHub Copilot is powered by OpenAI Codex, a generative pretrained language model created by OpenAI.

**Copilot works with many code editors including VS Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDE, and Neovim.**

Additionally, GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language.

Using Copilot inside a Codespace shows just how easy it is to get up and running with GitHub's suite of [Collaborative Coding](https://github.com/features#features-collaboration) tools.

 > **Note**
 > This skills exercise will focus on leveraging GitHub Codespace. It is recommended that you complete the GitHub skill, [Codespaces](https://github.com/skills/code-with-codespaces), before moving forward with this exercise.

### :keyboard: Activity: Enable Copilot inside a Codespace

**We recommend opening another browser tab to work through the following activities so you can keep these instructions open for reference.**

Before you open up a codespace on a repository, you can create a development container and define specific extensions or configurations that will be used or installed in your codespace. Let's create this development container and add copilot to the list of extensions.

1. Navigating back to your **Code** tab of your repository, click the **Add file** drop-down button, and then click `Create new file`.
1. Type or paste the following in the empty text field prompt to name your file.
   ```
   .devcontainer/devcontainer.json
   ```
1. In the body of the new **.devcontainer/devcontainer.json** file, add the following content:
   ```
   {
       // Name this configuration
       "name": "Codespace for Skills!",
       "customizations": {
           "vscode": {
               "extensions": [
                   "GitHub.copilot"
               ]
           }
       }
   }
   ```
1. Select the option to **Commit directly to the `main` branch**, and then click the **Commit new file** button.
1. Navigate back to the home page of your repository by clicking the **Code** tab located at the top left of the screen.
1. Click the **Code** button located in the middle of the page.
1. Click the **Codespaces** tab on the box that pops up.
1. Click the **Create codespace on main** button.

   **Wait about 2 minutes for the codespace to spin itself up.**

1. Verify your codespace is running. The browser should contain a VS Code web-based editor and a terminal should be present such as the below:

_Nice work! :tada: You created a Codespace using a devcontainer file that installed Copilot!_

GitHub Copilot provides suggestions for numerous languages and a wide variety of frameworks, but works especially well for Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Ruby, Go, C# and C++. The following samples are in JavaScript, but other languages will work similarly.

Let's try this out utilizing Javascript for Copilot.

### :keyboard: Activity: Add a Javascript file and start writing code

1. From inside the codespace in the VS Code explorer window, create a new file.

> **Note**:
> If you closed the Codespace from above, please open it back up or create a new Codespace.

2. Name the file `skills.js`
3. Verify your new file looks like:
 ![Screen Shot 2023-03-09 at 9 21 34 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26442605/224105906-d1beb531-b747-4c7a-85ba-a12526488422.png)
4. In the `skills.js` file, type the following function header.

   ```
   function calculateNumbers(var1, var2)
   ```
   GitHub Copilot will automatically suggest an entire function body in grayed text. Below is an example of what you'll most likely see, but the exact suggestion may vary.
